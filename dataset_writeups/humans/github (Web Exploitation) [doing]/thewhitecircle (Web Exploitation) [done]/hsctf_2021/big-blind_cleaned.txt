- we are given a login page in this challenge
- the page source does not contain any JS
- After trying several things I found that we get status 500 on using `'` in either username or password field
- we don’t get an error if we use `'` in both fields
- A better test is to use the following :

- in the above case we get an error which shows that its due to an un-closed `'`
- we don’t get an error in the following case :

- finally I confirmed that its blind SQL injection by using the following payload :

- so here it was clear that its MySQL because syntax for others are different
- I used `SUBSTRING` and `SLEEP` to bruteforce the flag one character at a time
- payload :

- Explanation :
    - substring function requires three arguments
    - first argument is the string which we want to check
    - second argument is the position which we want to check
    - third argument is the length we want to check
    - to check one character at a time I incremented second argument each time and kept third argument fixed
- Usage of `IF` :
    - If uses three arguments
    - first is the condition
    - second is action if condition is `True`
    - third is action if condition is `False`
    - so when we find a match we will see a sleep of 5 seconds else page will load immediately
