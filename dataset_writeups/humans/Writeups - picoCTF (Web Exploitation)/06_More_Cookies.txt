# Overview
Looking at the website, This is a continuation of the "Cookies" challenge. So let's have a look

This time the page reads "Welcome to my cookie search page. Only the admin can use it!" and the cookie is

It's a base64 but when I decode it, it's still in gibberish, So it's encrypted. Let's see the Hint

# Analysis
Hint 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption

It's a Wikipedia page for a very interesting encryption method, It's more like an algorithm than an encryption formula. I found this to be the hardest challenge in the web, Reading articles about Homomorphic encryption and looking at other writeups I understand that we do not have to decrypt it to solve it, Homomorphic encryption allows you to perform operations on encrypted text. Also, I noticed that the letters "CBC" are oddly capitalized in the challenge description. So, It's a CBC bitflip. Meaning the encrypted text contains a bit that determines if it's admin or not, so probably something like admin=0 but I don't know it's position so I brute forced it.

Here's the code
