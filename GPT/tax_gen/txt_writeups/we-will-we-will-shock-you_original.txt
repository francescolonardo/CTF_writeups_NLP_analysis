Challenge

:)
http://104.197.168.32:17012/index.html

Solution
The name of the challenge reminds the Shellshock vulnerability.
The homepage seems to be an apache2 default index, but analyzing the HTML source an interesting comment can be discovered.

Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works







          Apache2 Debian Default Page
        



    <div class="section_header section_header_red">
      <div id="about"></div>
      It works!
    </div>
    <div class="content_section_text">
      <p>
            This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
            operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems.
            If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
            this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
            <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

            Configuration Overview
    </div>
    <div class="content_section_text">
      <p>
            Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
            upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
            interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
            <b>fully documented in
            /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
            documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
            found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
            package was installed on this server.

      </p>
      <p>
            The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>

/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       --  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       -- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|-- *.conf
          


apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        
                    <li>
                       <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                       main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                       incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                       Configuration files in the <tt>mods-enabled/</tt>,
                       <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                       particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                       fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                       They are activated by symlinking available
                       configuration files from their respective
                       *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                       by using our helpers
                       <tt>
                            a2enmod,
                            a2dismod,
                       </tt>
                       <tt>
                            a2ensite,
                            a2dissite,
                        </tt>
                            and
                       <tt>
                            a2enconf,
                            a2disconf
                       </tt>. See their respective man pages for detailed information.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                       The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
                       environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                       started/stopped with <tt>/etc/init.d/apache2</tt> or <tt>apache2ctl</tt>.
                       <b>Calling <tt>/usr/bin/apache2</tt> directly will not work</b> with the
                       default configuration.
                    </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="content_section_text">
        <p>
            By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to
            <em>any</em> file apart of those located in <tt>/var/www</tt>,
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html" rel="nofollow">public_html</a>
            directories (when enabled) and <tt>/usr/share</tt> (for web
            applications). If your site is using a web document root
            located elsewhere (such as in <tt>/srv</tt>) you may need to whitelist your
            document root directory in <tt>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default Debian document root is <tt>/var/www/html</tt>. You
            can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
            to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.

Again some hints that lead to Shellshock.

The ls payload will reveal the presence of a flag_for_this_INFERNO.txt file that can be easily downloaded with the following URL.

http://104.197.168.32:17012/flag_for_this_INFERNO.txt

The file will contain the flag.
